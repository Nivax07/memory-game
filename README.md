# Memory Game

A memory game where cards are displayed on a board and when clicked, are turned around. There are total of 16 cards and your score will depend on your total star (corresponding to number of moves) and your time to finish the game.
The objective is to flip the corresponding cards resulting in a match, in as little time and as few moves as possible.
